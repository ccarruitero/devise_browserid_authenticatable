================================

Written by Dennis Schubert

devise_browserid_authenticatable is [BrowserID/Persona](https://persona.org) authentication support for
[Devise](http://github.com/plataformatec/devise) applications. I created this little gem because there
was nothing suitable.

More infomration about requirements, installation and usage soon.
